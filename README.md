### Thomas Guillod - otvam

I am a **power electronics engineer and research scientist**. I studied at ETH Zurich, Switzerland (Bachelor, Master, and Ph.D) with a focus on power electronics, medium-voltage systems, and numerical analysis. I am currently doing **research on magnetic component and material modeling** at **Dartmouth College, USA**. My research interests include high-frequency magnetic components, high-frequency power magnetic materials, and advanced modeling techniques.

With my engineering and research activities, I am developing several **open-source software and libraries** for electrical engineering and numerical analysis (Python and MATLAB).
