### Thomas Guillod - otvam

I am a **power electronics engineer and research engineer**. I studied at ETH Zurich, Switzerland (Bachelor, Master, and Ph.D) with a focus on power electronics, medium-voltage systems, and numerical analysis. My research interests include high-frequency magnetic components, medium-voltage engineering, high-frequency power magnetic materials, and advanced modeling techniques.

With my engineering and research activities, I am developing several **open-source software and libraries** for electrical engineering and numerical analysis (Python and MATLAB).
